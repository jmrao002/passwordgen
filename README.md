# Description

This browser application allows users to click a button to generate a password containing a series of random values. Once the Generate button is clicked, the user must answer a series of prompts to define the password parameters. The user first must choose the password length, then once a valid length is entered, the user may choose if the password should contain one or more of the following character types: upper case, lower case, special, and/or numeric. After valid selections are made, the randomly generated password is written to the text box, where the user can highlight and copy for use elsewhere.
